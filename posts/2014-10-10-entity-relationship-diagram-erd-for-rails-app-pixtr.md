> Clarify relationship logic. That's my destiny. --- ERD

If you have two models in your app, you could easily handle the relationship, since it can't be more complicated than a many-to-many relationship. What if you have five or even more models and they are associated?

Entity Relationship Diagram is the solution. ERD is used to illustrate the relationship between different models clearly before we starting creating models.

Here is ERD for Pixtr app. Blue ones are tables for models, orange ones are join tables, red one is both join table and table for model.
